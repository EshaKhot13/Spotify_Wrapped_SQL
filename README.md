# 🎵 Spotify Wrapped SQL Analysis  

## 📋 Project Overview  

Ever wondered what your Spotify Wrapped *didn't* tell you?  

This project is a **SQL-powered deep dive** into my 2024 Spotify streaming habits, based on over **20,000 rows** of listening data from March 2024 to May 2025.  

Unlike the official Spotify Wrapped, which offers a polished summary, this analysis goes **under the hood** using raw data and SQL queries to uncover:

- 🔁 My **most repeated songs** (even across distinct days)  
- 🎤 Artists I came back to **month after month**  
- ☀️ **Seasonal favorites**: what I listened to most in summer vs. winter  
- ⏱️ Total time spent listening 
- 📅 Most music-filled days of the year  
- ⏭️ How often I skipped tracks (played < 30 seconds)

By transforming JSON data into a relational table and running custom SQL queries, I was able to build my own version of Wrapped, with way more flexibility and **personalized insights Spotify never shows you**.

Whether you’re into analytics, music, or both, this project shows what’s possible when you combine raw listening data with the power of SQL.

## Get Your Personal Data from Spotify

### I exported my **Spotify streaming history** and loaded it into a MySQL database to perform SQL-based analytics.  
The dataset includes the following key fields:

- `endTime`: When the track finished playing  
- `artistName`: Artist’s name  
- `trackName`: Track name  
- `msPlayed`: Duration played in milliseconds  

---

## 🛠️ Data Preparation  

### ✅ Cleaning  
- Converted JSON to a table named `history`  
- Removed unnecessary columns and rows with missing values  
- Standardized time to minutes (`msPlayed / 60000`) for analysis  

### 🧮 SQL Setup
```sql
USE newwrapped;
SHOW TABLES;

-- Preview and validate
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM history;
SELECT * FROM history LIMIT 5;
```

## 📈 Learnings & Highlights  
Through this project, I gained deeper insight into both my **listening habits** and the power of SQL for storytelling with data. Here are some standout takeaways:

- Mastered SQL aggregation, grouping, and date formatting  
- Used **window functions**: `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`  
- Learned to clean real-world data for analytical storytelling  
- Identified unique musical habits using only SQL, no dashboards or Python needed!

## 🧰 Tools Used  

- Spotify History Data
- **MySQL** Workbench

### 💡 SQL Skills Used  

- `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`: `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `DENSE_RANK()`  
- `AGGREGATIONS`: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `FLOOR()`  
- `DATE FUNCTIONS`: `MONTH()`, `DATE_FORMAT()`, `YEAR()`  
- `SUBQUERIES`, `CTEs`, and `PARTITION BY`
